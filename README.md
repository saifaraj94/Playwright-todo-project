# Playwright Todo Project

This project demonstrates a **scalable and maintainable test automation framework** using Playwright. It combines **UI and API testing** with clean architecture principles to ensure reusable and easy-to-maintain tests.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organized UI tests for better readability and maintainability.  
- ✅ **API Testing with Playwright**: Uses Playwright’s `APIRequestContext` to validate backend endpoints.  
- ✅ **Dynamic Test Data**: Generates realistic test data using `Faker.js`.  
- ✅ **Cookie-Based Authentication**: Combines API login with UI tests for faster and more reliable testing.  
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps UI and API logic separate for clean and modular test code.  
- ✅ **Reusable Components**: Includes reusable model classes (e.g., `User`) and API wrappers.  
- ✅ **Scalable Test Structure**: Designed to easily add new tests or extend functionality without breaking existing ones.  

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand **how to build maintainable automation frameworks**, not just individual tests. By applying clean architecture principles and reusable components, I improved **test efficiency, reliability, and scalability**.
